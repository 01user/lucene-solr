<<Convex Hull, Convex Hull>> -
<<Enclosing Disk, Enclosing Disk>>


== Convex Hull

A convex hull is the smallest convex set of points that encloses a data set. Math expressions has support for computing
the convex hull of a 2D data set. Once a convex hull has been calculated, a set of math expression functions
can be applied to geometrically describe the convex hull.



=== Visualization

The `convexHull` function can be used visualize a border around a set of 2D

== Enclosing Disk

The `enclosingDisk` function finds the smallest enclosing circle the encloses a 2D data set.
Once an enclosing disk has been calculated, a set of math expression functions
can be applied to geometrically describe the enclosing disk.

In the example below an enclosing disk is calculated for a randomly generated set of 1000 2D observations.

Then the following functions are called on the enclosing disk:

-`getCenter`: Returns the 2D point that is the center of the disk.

-`getRadius`: Returns the radius of the disk.

-`getSupportPoints`: Returns the support points of the disk.

let(echo="center, radius, support",
    x=sample(normalDistribution(0, 20), 1000),
    y=sample(normalDistribution(0, 20), 1000),
    observations=transpose(matrix(x,y)),
    disk=enclosingDisk(observations),
    center=getCenter(disk),
    radius=getRadius(disk),
    support=getSupportPoints(disk))
