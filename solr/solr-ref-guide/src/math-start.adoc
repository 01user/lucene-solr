== Language Notes

*Streaming Expressions* and *Math Expressions* are expression languages that run
inside Solr Cloud. The languages consists of function expressions that are designed
to be nested or *composed*.  Streaming Expressions and Math Expressions can be combined to *search, sort,
sample, aggregate, transform, analyse* and *visualize* data in Solr Cloud collections.

*Streaming Expressions* all return streams of data. This allows Streaming Expressions to be
composed in ways that form a pipeline. A *Stream Source*, such as *search*, initiates
a stream of Tuples. A Stream Decorator, such as *select*, wraps the Stream Source and transforms
the stream of Tuples.

*Math Expressions* do not return streams of data. Math Expressions return primatives and in-memory
arrays and matrices. Many of the Math Expression are designed to work on arrays and matrices
to perform *statistical* and mathematical operations.




== Executing Streaming Expressions and Math Expressions

Solr's /stream handler excuted Streaming Expressions and Math Expressions. The easiest way
run Streaming Expression and Math expressions is through *stream* panel on the Solr admin
UI.

A sample *search* Streaming Expression is shown is screensheet below:

A sample *add* Streaming Expression is shown is screensheet below:
