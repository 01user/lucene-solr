Monte Carlo simulations are commonly used to model the behavior of
stochastic (random) systems. This section of the overview of Math Expressions
Monte Carlo simulations.

== A Random Walk

The stochastic system that will be studied is daily stock returns calculated
as the closing price minus the opening price. These daily moves are often
described as a "random walk" because they cannot be predicted.

The first step in understanding the random walk is to visualize it. The example
below shows the variable *change_d* which is the daily change in stock price for
1000 days of the *cvx* stock ticker (Chevron).
