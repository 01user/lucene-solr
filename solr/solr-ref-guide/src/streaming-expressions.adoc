Streaming Expressions exposes the capabilities of Solr Cloud as composable functions. These functions provide a system for
searching, transforming, analyzing and visualizing data stored in Solr Cloud collections.

At a high level there a four main capabilities that will be explored in the documentation:

* *Searching*, sampling and aggregating results from Solr.

* *Transforming* result sets after they are retrieved from Solr.

* *Analyzing* and modeling result sets using probability and statistics and machine learning libraries.

* *Visualizing* result sets, aggregations and statistical models of the data.

=======
Streaming Expressions provide a simple yet powerful stream processing language for SolrCloud.

Streaming expressions are a suite of functions that can be combined to perform many different parallel computing tasks. These functions are the basis for the <<parallel-sql-interface.adoc#parallel-sql-interface,Parallel SQL Interface>>.

There is a growing library of functions that can be combined to implement:

* Request/response stream processing
* Batch stream processing
* Fast interactive MapReduce
* Aggregations (Both pushed down faceted and shuffling MapReduce)
* Parallel relational algebra (distributed joins, intersections, unions, complements)
* Publish/subscribe messaging
* Distributed graph traversal
* Machine learning and parallel iterative model training
* Anomaly detection
* Recommendation systems
* Retrieve and rank services
* Text classification and feature extraction
* Streaming NLP
* Statistical Programming

Streams from outside systems can be joined with streams originating from Solr and users can add their own stream functions by following Solr's {solr-javadocs}/solrj/org/apache/solr/client/solrj/io/stream/package-summary.html[Java streaming API].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Both streaming expressions and the streaming API are considered experimental, and the APIs are subject to change.

== Stream Language Basics

Streaming Expressions are comprised of streaming functions which work with a Solr collection. They emit a stream of tuples (key/value Maps).

Some of the provided streaming functions are designed to work with entire result sets rather than the top N results like normal search. This is supported by the <<exporting-result-sets.adoc#exporting-result-sets,/export handler>>.

Some streaming functions act as stream sources to originate the stream flow. Other streaming functions act as stream decorators to wrap other stream functions and perform operations on the stream of tuples. Many streams functions can be parallelized across a worker collection. This can be particularly powerful for relational algebra functions.

=== Streaming Requests and Responses

Solr has a `/stream` request handler that takes streaming expression requests and returns the tuples as a JSON stream. This request handler is implicitly defined, meaning there is nothing that has to be defined in `solrconfig.xml` - see <<implicit-requesthandlers.adoc#implicit-requesthandlers,Implicit RequestHandlers>>.

The `/stream` request handler takes one parameter, `expr`, which is used to specify the streaming expression. For example, this curl command encodes and POSTs a simple `search()` expression to the `/stream` handler:

[source,bash]
----
curl --data-urlencode 'expr=search(enron_emails,
                                   q="from:1800flowers*",
                                   fl="from, to",
                                   sort="from asc")' http://localhost:8983/solr/enron_emails/stream
----

Details of the parameters for each function are included below.

For the above example the `/stream` handler responded with the following JSON response:

[source,json]
----
{"result-set":{"docs":[
   {"from":"1800flowers.133139412@s2u2.com","to":"lcampbel@enron.com"},
   {"from":"1800flowers.93690065@s2u2.com","to":"jtholt@ect.enron.com"},
   {"from":"1800flowers.96749439@s2u2.com","to":"alewis@enron.com"},
   {"from":"1800flowers@1800flowers.flonetwork.com","to":"lcampbel@enron.com"},
   {"from":"1800flowers@1800flowers.flonetwork.com","to":"lcampbel@enron.com"},
   {"from":"1800flowers@1800flowers.flonetwork.com","to":"lcampbel@enron.com"},
   {"from":"1800flowers@1800flowers.flonetwork.com","to":"lcampbel@enron.com"},
   {"from":"1800flowers@1800flowers.flonetwork.com","to":"lcampbel@enron.com"},
   {"from":"1800flowers@shop2u.com","to":"ebass@enron.com"},
   {"from":"1800flowers@shop2u.com","to":"lcampbel@enron.com"},
   {"from":"1800flowers@shop2u.com","to":"lcampbel@enron.com"},
   {"from":"1800flowers@shop2u.com","to":"lcampbel@enron.com"},
   {"from":"1800flowers@shop2u.com","to":"ebass@enron.com"},
   {"from":"1800flowers@shop2u.com","to":"ebass@enron.com"},
   {"EOF":true,"RESPONSE_TIME":33}]}
}
----

Note the last tuple in the above example stream is `{"EOF":true,"RESPONSE_TIME":33}`. The `EOF` indicates the end of the stream. To process the JSON response, you'll need to use a streaming JSON implementation because streaming expressions are designed to return the entire result set which may have millions of records. In your JSON client you'll need to iterate each doc (tuple) and check for the EOF tuple to determine the end of stream.

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
The {solr-javadocs}/solrj/org/apache/solr/client/solrj/io/package-summary.html[`org.apache.solr.client.solrj.io`] package provides Java classes that compile streaming expressions into streaming API objects. These classes can be used to execute streaming expressions from inside a Java application. For example:

== Elements of the Lanaguage

=== Stream Sources

Stream sources originate streams. There are rich set of searching, sampling and aggregation stream sources to choose from.

A full reference to all available source expressions is available in <<stream-source-reference.adoc#stream-source-reference,Stream Source Reference>>.


=== Stream Decorators

<<<<<<< HEAD
Stream decorators wrap stream sources and other stream decorators to transform a stream.
=======
=== Request Routing

Streaming Expressions respect the <<distributed-requests.adoc#shards-preference-parameter,shards.preference parameter>> for any call to Solr.

The value of `shards.preference` that is used to route requests is determined in the following order. The first option available is used.
- Provided as a parameter in the streaming expression (e.g., `search(...., shards.preference="replica.type:PULL")`)
- Provided in the URL Params of the streaming expression (e.g., `http://solr_url:8983/solr/stream?expr=....&shards.preference=replica.type:PULL`)
- Set as a default in the Cluster properties.

=== Adding Custom Expressions

Creating your own custom expressions can be easily done by implementing the {solr-javadocs}/solrj/org/apache/solr/client/solrj/io/stream/expr/Expressible.html[Expressible] interface.   To add a custom expression to the
list of known mappings for the `/stream` and `/graph` handlers, you just need to declare it as a plugin in `solrconfig.xml` via:

[source,xml]
<expressible name="custom" class="org.example.CustomStreamingExpression"/>


== Types of Streaming Expressions
>>>>>>> master

A full reference to all available decorator expressions is available in <<stream-decorator-reference.adoc#stream-decorator-reference,Stream Decorator Reference>>.

=== Math Expressions

Math expressions are a vector and matrix math library that can be combined with streaming expressions to perform analysis and build mathematical models
of the result sets. From a language standpoint Math Expressions are a sub-langauge of streaming expressions that don't return streams of tuples. Instead
they operate on and return numbers, vectors, matrices and mathematical models. The documentation will show how to combine Streaming Expressions and Math
Expressions.

The Math Expressions user guide is available in <<>>

From a language standpoint Math Expressions are referred to as Stream Evaluators.

A full reference to all available evaluator expressions is available in <<stream-evaluator-reference.adoc#stream-evaluator-reference,Stream Evaluator Reference>>.

=== Visualization


Visualization of both Streaming Expressions and Math Expressions is done using Apache Zeppelin and the Zeppelin-Solr Interpreter.

Visualizing Streaming expressions and setting up of Apache Zeppelin is documented in<<>>

The Math Expressions user guide has in depth coverage of visualization techniques.
