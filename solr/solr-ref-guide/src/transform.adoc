== Selecting and Adding Fields

The `select` function wraps another streaming expression and can select a
subset of fields, map fields to new
names and/or add new fields to each tuple in the stream.

Below is an example showing the `select` function wrapping a `search` function
and mapping fields to new field names. The `recNum` function is a math expression
which the `select` expression calls on each tuple. More examples of this type
of streaming math will be shown later in the userguide.

== Filtering Tuples

The `having` function can be used to filter tuples in the stream based
boolean logic.

In the example below the `having` function is filtering the output of the
`facet` function to only emit tuples that have `count(*)` greater then 20404.

== Handling Nulls

The `notNull` and `isNull` function can be used to either replace null values with different values,
or to filter out tuples with null values.

The example below is using the `isNull` function inside of `select` function
to replace null values with -1. The `if` function takes 3 parameters. The first
is a boolean expression, in this case `isNull`. The `if` function returns
the secopnd parameter if the boolean function returns true, and the third
parameter if it returns false. In this case `isNull` is always true because its
check for a field in the tuples that is not included in the result set.

`notNull` and `isNull` can also be used with the `having` function to filter out
tuples with null values.

The example below emits all the documents because it is evaluating `isNull` for
and field that is not in the result set, which always returns true.

The example below emits zero documents because it is evaluating `notNull` for
and field that is not in the result set, which always returns false.

== Regex Matching

The `matches` function can used to perform regex matches on fields ...

== Paging

== Sorting

== Rollups
