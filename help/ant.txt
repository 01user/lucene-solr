Unless stated otherwise examples below assume current working directory
and gradlew script in the top directory of the project's checkout.


Common Ant tasks and their equivalence in Gradle
------------------------------------------------

ant compile => gradlew compileJava
ant jar => gradlew package
ant clean  => gradlew clean
ant clean-jars => [no replacement - JARs sourced directly from gradle caches]
ant jar-checksums => gradlew jarChecksums
ant test => gradlew test [or better (includes any other verification
tasks): gradlew check]
ant validate => gradlew check
ant precommit => gradlew check -x test (under development)
